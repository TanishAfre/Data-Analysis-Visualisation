Global Relevance: The World Happiness Report serves as a propper review which reflects the state of global happiness,
     shedding light on how different nations prioritize the well-being of their citizens. 

Multidimensional Approach: This report encompasses a variety of indicators, including economic wealth (GDP per capita),
     social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption, 
     offering a holistic view of happiness and well-being.

Public Interest and Awareness: it highlights public awareness regarding the factors that contribute to happiness, 
     promoting a better understanding of how societal values and policies align with individual well-being.
     
As mentioned in the project specification document, this database fits perfectly in all the criterias.

|***********************Identify the Problem and Justification************************|
|_____________________________________________________________________________________|

It remains one of the most central goals belonging to being human—the pursuit of happiness—and what its 
constituents are remains a hot issue for all people, particularly for policymakers. Over time, the conventional 
metrics used include the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in measuring the success level of countries, and it, however, 
fails to capture quality of life and well-being among citizens. The World Happiness Report is a valuable database 
in its assessment, indicating progress in a much more holistic view, since it covers contributing factors to happiness 
and well-being.

The justification for choosing the World Happiness Report is twofold: One, the report is anchored on a significant 
empirical study for measuring the happiness of populations around the world. It may be economic wealth, social support, 
freedom, trust in governance, or longevity. These are the ingredients, which, when mixed together, are somehow trying 
to describe a more vivid meaning of what makes life worth living. 

The work makes a contribution to an expanded discussion of human development that adds emotional health and satisfaction 
to the list of "goods" societies should be aiming for. As such, this year's edition provides a more solid and nuanced 
data set for the World Happiness Report, building an index that should reflect not just the multi-dimensionality of 
happiness but also possibly help guide policy for better lives for citizens around the world.

|******************Relevance of the World Happiness Report Data***********************|
|_____________________________________________________________________________________|

The World Happiness Report is a suitable database to be used in the construction of a composite happiness index, 
considering that it gives a strong, multifaceted picture of well-being all around the world.  The report's data are 
collected consistently across countries, enabling comparative analysis. It does reflect the outcomes of national policies 
and the individual circumstances on perceived life satisfaction and, therefore, is highly useful for representing a 
tool in the study of the complexities in happiness and its drivers, central to human development and policy making.

|*************************Addressing Multidimensionality******************************|
|_____________________________________________________________________________________|

This shows the complexity of happiness in its multidimensional form and the fact that some of its subjective variables, 
such as emotional well-being and cultural idiosyncrasies, may remain unelaborated. Still, this must be underlined with all 
due importance to unquantifiable variables that might play a role in influencing happiness. In this regard, future 
improvements should invite personalized metrics that mirror individual experiences and a wide diversity across different 
cultures in order to understand global happiness at much deeper levels.
